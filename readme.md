#Password-Generator

Tired of using Password1! as your password? This program generates a virtually unhackable password with upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, then stores it for you. Or if you already have a password for an account, but don't want to forget it, you can simply enter it to be stored. Passwords previously stored can be searched for at any time.

The module pyperclip is used for convenience, but is not necessary.
